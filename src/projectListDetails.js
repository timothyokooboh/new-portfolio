        projectPurpose: `I built this project because I like to solve real world problems
        with my code.
        By the way, I am also a Pharmacist ðŸ˜‡. So I saw it as an opportunity to give back to the pharmacy profession.
        It was also an opportunity to practice the things I have learned in Nuxt.js. So this was the first project I built with Nuxt.js`,
        projectStack: "Nuxt.js, Node/Express.js, MongoDB",
        challenges: `
            One of the challenges I faced was how to store and persist sensitive user's data without utilizing web storage e.g local storage.
            For example, I wanted to store data regarding whether a user has made payment or not. I knew that if I saved that information in web storage,
            the data could be manipulated by users. To solve that challenge, I leveraged the "nuxtServerInit" action 
            provided by Nuxt.js. So just before the client side is rendered to authenticated users, I retrieve the
            user's unique ID (provided by mongoDB) from cookies. Then I call a function that fetches the user's information from the server and 
            use the returned data to initialize Vuex store.
            That way, I only needed to store the user's ID in cookies and be rest assured that on page refresh, I will always retrieve
            the user's data from the server via server side rendering.

            I learned how to extend my knowledge of Vue.js to 
            build server side rendered apps with Nuxt.js.

        projectDescription: `MyFastMeds is an E-Pharmacy application currently in development.
        It has an e-commerce feature that allows users to add medicines to cart, update the quantity of items and checkout
        to make payment.
        There is an online consultation feature in which patients can have consultation sessions with
        health care professionals via chat or video. I started the project with Nuxt.js. But I'm currently migrating the 
        codebase to Quasar so that I can deploy it on Android, IOS and the web.

        challenges: `
            Because this is a real world application and not a demo application with e-commerce feature, I wanted
            to avoid a situation whereby users could manipulate cart specific data such as the price of items.
            Therefore, I decided to not save information regarding the cart to local storage. Instead, I created
            a cart model on the server side which allowed me to store and retrieve details regarding a user's cart.
            One downside to this approach was that users can only add an item to cart or view saved items in cart only when they
            are logged in.
            I maintained this approach because it helped to solve the problem I was avoiding. Moreover, users would still need
            to login before they can checkout and make payment.
